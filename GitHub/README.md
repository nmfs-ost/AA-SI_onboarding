# NOAA Enterprise GitHub
The AA-SI GitHub site is public, but to work with the site (e.g., edit pages) a person needs to have a NOAA GitHub Enterprise License.

## NEFSC
At the **NEFSC**, the enterprise licenses are managed by the IT division. To get an enterprise license submit a helpdesk ticket. You can submit a general ticket, or click on "Applications" on the left, and then "GitHub Support Request" on the right for a potentially quicker response.
