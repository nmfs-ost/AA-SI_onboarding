# Google Cloud Workspace

## Background  
Our Google workspace has computing environments (i.e., workstations) and a storage bucket. These have been set up by Josh Lee (joshua.lee@noaa.gov) and Ed Rodgers (ed.rodgers@noaa.gov) from NOAA's [Cloud Program Office](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/noaa-cloud-program-office-ncpo). Our intitial workstations were "test" stations and we are in the process of building our "permanent" stations. This document provides details on how to set up the workstation and connect to the storage bucket.
