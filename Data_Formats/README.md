# Data Formats
The AA-SI will work primarily with active acoustic data collected by Kongsberg EK scientific [echosounders](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/AA-SI_onboarding/tree/main/Instruments). In addition to the active acoustic data, we will work with contextual data, such as biological, oceanographic, meteorological, and other benthic and pelagic habitat data. NOTE: add links to sections as we work with those data.
