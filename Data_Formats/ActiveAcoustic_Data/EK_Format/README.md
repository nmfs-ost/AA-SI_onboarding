# Kongsberg EK Data Format
Data formats for the Kongsberg EK echosounders have changed with each model and within models. While these formats are proprietary to the manufacturer, the formats are published for anyone to write custom software to read the data files. Almost all fisheries institutions that use the active acoustic data have custom-built software to read, process, and analyze the data, and in addition, many use a commercial software package, [Echoview](https://echoview.com/) to read, process, and analyze the data.
