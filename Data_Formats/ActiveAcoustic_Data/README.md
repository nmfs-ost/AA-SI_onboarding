# Active Acoustic Data
The scientific [echosounders](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/AA-SI_onboarding/tree/main/Instruments) record data to manufacturer-specified binary formats. The AA-SI will work primarily with Kongsberg EK echosounders and data, but there are other echosounder manufacturers whose data we may use. We will update this site as we add other data sources.

## Kongsberg EK Data

## netCDF4 Format
As NOAA Fisheries active acoustic data have become public through NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information [NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/water-column-sonar-data) or other portals, the ability for those outside of the fisheries institutions to utilize the data for purposes other than fisheries stock assessments is quite arduous to impossible. To broaden the utility of active acoustic data, the fisheries acoustics community has developed open data formats so that the data can be read by any software language. Early attempts included the [HAC](https://ices-library.figshare.com/articles/report/Description_of_the_ICES_HAC_Standard_Data_Exchange_Format_Version_1_60/18624254?file=33403313) format, but these have mostly been supplanted by [netCDF4](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html). The AA-SI will be using the netCDF4 convention.
