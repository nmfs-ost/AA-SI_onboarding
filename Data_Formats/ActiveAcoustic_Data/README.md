# Active Acoustic Data
The scientific [echosounders](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/AA-SI_onboarding/tree/main/Instruments) record data to manufacturer-specified binary formats. Data formats for the Kongsberg EK echosounders have changed with each model and within models. While these formats are proprietary to the manufacturer, the formats are published for anyone to write custom software to read the data files. Almost all fisheries institutions that use the active acoustic data have custom-built software to read, process, and analyze the data, and in addition, many use a commercial software package, [Echoview](https://echoview.com/) to read, process, and analyze the data. 
  
Over the years, this process has worked for individual institutions, but as the active acoustic data have become public through NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information [NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/water-column-sonar-data) or other portals, the ability for those outside of the fisheries institutions to utilize the data for purposes other than fisheries single-species stock assessments is quite arduous to impossible. To broaden the utility of active acoustic data, the fisheries acoustics community has developed open data formats so that the data can be read by any software language. Early attempts included the [HAC](https://ices-library.figshare.com/articles/report/Description_of_the_ICES_HAC_Standard_Data_Exchange_Format_Version_1_60/18624254?file=33403313) format, but have mostly been supplanted by [netCDF4](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html). The AA-SI will be using the netCDF4 convention.
