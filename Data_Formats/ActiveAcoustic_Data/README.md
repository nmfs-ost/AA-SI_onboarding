# Active Acoustic Data
The scientific [echosounders](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/AA-SI_onboarding/tree/main/Instruments) record data to manufacturer-specified binary formats. The AA-SI will work primarily with Kongsberg EK echosounders and data, but there are other echosounder manufacturers whose data we may use. We will update this site as we add other data sources.
