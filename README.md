## Welcome!
Are you new to the AA-SI or just want a refresher? Here is the site for you!  


2) Add [topics](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) to help users find repositories.
3) [Add a license](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository). **This is a MUST for public repositories.** If you are migrating a private repository, it is strongly advised to add a license but not required. Work written by For work  produced by U.S. government employees, we are required to use an [open source license](https://opensource.org/license). If contributors other than FTEs wrote code and the repository does not yet have an open source license, make sure all parties agree before applying an open source license. For data/documentation, use [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/). For code, common choices include [Apache 2.0](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0) and [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit).
5) For public repositories, you may delete the file `.github/workflows/secretSCAN.yml`. This is because [GitHub secret scanning is used in Public Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/configuring-secret-scanning-for-your-repositories#enabling-secret-scanning-alerts-for-users).
6) Once you have completed the steps, delete the instructions from this `README.md`.
